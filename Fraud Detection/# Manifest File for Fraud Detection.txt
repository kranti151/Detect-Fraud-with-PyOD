# Author: (Komalben Suthar)
# Date: 2025-06-22

# Project Files:
fraud_detection_autoencoder.py      # Main Python script containing data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization
requirements.txt                    # List of Python dependencies to install via pip
creditcard.csv                     # Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset 

# Python Environment:
Python version: 3.8 or higher

# Dependencies (can be installed using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'):
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pyod

# How to run:
1. Download 'creditcard.csv' dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
2. Place 'creditcard.csv' in the project root directory
3. Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the main script:
     python fraud_detection_autoencoder.py

# Output:
- Classification report with precision, recall, F1-score
- AUC-ROC score
- Plots of anomaly scores with thresholds
- Scatter plot of transactions colored by anomaly scores

# Notes:
- The AutoEncoder model uses unsupervised learning to detect anomalies.
- Threshold for anomaly detection is automatically set based on training data.
- Visualizations aid understanding model behavior and anomaly detection quality.
